Project Overview: Attendance and Payroll Management System 

Project Introduction
This project, centered around an Attendance and Payroll Management System, is engineered using React.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and Microsoft SQL for database management. It encompasses a comprehensive array of functionalities. The system is divided into two main interfaces: one for employees, enabling them to log their arrival and departure times, and an administrative panel that offers extensive control over monthly attendance reports, employee management (Create, Read, Update, Delete - CRUD), overtime regulation, schedule adjustments, deduction implementation, among other capabilities. Employees are required to enter their ID to register their attendance, a detail that can be accessed through the Admin Panel.
System Details
The administrative authority possesses complete oversight over the system, facilitating a broad spectrum of operations directly from the Admin Panel. This includes monitoring attendance, managing employee records, overseeing overtime and cash advances, scheduling, implementing deductions, assigning positions, and administering payroll. A notable feature is the system's ability to automatically generate attendance statistics, visually represented through bar graphs that highlight punctuality and tardiness across months and years.

For employee onboarding, essential information such as first name, last name, address, date of birth, contact information, gender, job position, work schedule, and a photograph must be submitted. Additionally, users have the privilege of updating their profiles, including password and profile picture changes, at any given time. In terms of overtime management, it's necessary to input an employee's ID along with the date, hours, and minutes worked, plus the applicable rate.

Furthermore, when handling the records of cash advances issued to employees, the admin is required to specify the employee's ID and the advance amount. Other critical operations include managing deductions—where a description and deduction amount need to be specified—and payroll processing. The payroll system intuitively calculates each employee's net salary by considering their gross income, any deductions, and cash advances. The administrative dashboard is designed to be both clean and responsive, ensuring straightforward system management.

All essential features have been integrated into the project to streamline the management of employee attendance and payroll for companies. With its elegant and user-friendly design, the system aims to provide a seamless experience for its users, making it easier for them to navigate and utilize its functionalities effectively.
